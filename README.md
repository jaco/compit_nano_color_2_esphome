# Compit Nano Color 2 esphome

Esphome RS485 config for Compit Nano Color 2.

## Hardware

I used [m5stack ATOM Lite with RS485 module](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-rs485-kit) but any ESP32/ESP8266 with RS485 to ttl will do.

It's a great module because it can be powered directly from the Nano Color2.
